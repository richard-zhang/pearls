# A future of value semantics and generic programming

## Generic Programming

- not template meta programming

### An example of generic programming
- Segmented Iterators and Hierachical Algorithms

### Another example: The Boost Graph Library

## Value Semantics

- value semantics
- pervasive references cause issues
- object mutation (reentrancy)
- reference semantics and risk condition are good friends 

- formal definition
  - regularity
  - independence
    - as threadsafe as inm
